## Respiratory Disease Classification using Lung Sound

# Overview
This project aims to classify respiratory diseases based on lung sound recordings. The dataset used for this project is the Respiratory Sound Database available on Kaggle.

Welcome to our respiratory health repository. Using CNN algorithms, we detect URTI, Bronchiolitis, pneumonia, COPD. Our platform offers real-time auscultation and long-term monitoring tools. Accessible via our user-friendly website, input disease audio for instant predictions. Join us in improving pulmonary diagnostics and patient outcomes

Respiratory sounds are important indicators of respiratory health and respiratory disorders. The sound emitted when a person breathes is directly related to air movement, changes within lung tissue and the position of secretions within the lung. A wheezing sound, for example, is a common sign that a patient has an obstructive airway disease like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

These sounds can be recorded using digital stethoscopes and other recording techniques. This digital data opens up the possibility of using machine learning to automatically diagnose respiratory disorders like asthma, pneumonia and bronchiolitis, to name a few.


# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Respiratory Sound Database available on Kaggle. It contains audio recordings of respiratory sounds from patients with different respiratory conditions. The dataset can be downloaded from  kaggle.com/datasets/vbookshelf/respiratory-sound-database?resource=download

This  dataset includes:

920 .wav sound files
920 annotation .txt files
A text file listing the diagnosis for each patient
A text file explaining the file naming format
A text file listing 91 names (filename_differences.txt )
A text file containing demographic information for each patient
